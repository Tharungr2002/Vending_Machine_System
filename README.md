Step 1: Clarify Requirements
Functional Requirements:
The system should support multiple products with different prices and quantities.
The system should accept notes of different denominations ($1, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100).
The system should dispense selected products and return change if necessary.
The system should track available products and quantities (inventory management).
The system should handle multiple transactions concurrently and ensure data consistency.
The system should provide admin interface for restocking products and collecting money.
The system should handle exceptional scenarios (insufficient funds, out-of-stock products).
The system should ensure operations are only allowed in appropriate states.
The system should manage the following operational states:
IDLE: Ready to accept new transactions, users can browse and select products.
PROCESSING_PAYMENT: User has selected product and is paying, can insert money or cancel.
DISPENSING: Payment complete, machine is dispensing product and change.
OUT_OF_SERVICE: Machine is not operational due to maintenance or malfunction.

Interview Tip: Always ask the interviewer to confirm the requirements before jumping into code. It shows clarity and alignment.

Edge Cases to Consider
Concurrent access to same product.
Insufficient change in machine.
Power failure.
Product out of stock during transaction.
Payment failure scenarios.

Step 2: Identify Core Entities
1. VendingMachine (Core Entity)
id: int [PK]
location: String
currentState: VendingMachineState
isOperational: boolean
2. Product
id: int [PK]
name: String
price: Double
category: ProductCategory (Enum: BEVERAGE, SNACK, CANDY, etc.)
3. Inventory
productId: int [FK]
vendingMachineId: int [FK]
quantity: int
minThreshold: int (for restocking alerts)
4. CashBox
id: int [PK]
vendingMachineId: int [FK]
denominations: Map<Denomination, Integer> (denomination → count)
totalAmount: Double
5. Denomination (Enum)
ONE_DOLLAR(100)
FIVE_DOLLAR(500)
TEN_DOLLAR(1000)
TWENTY_DOLLAR(2000)
FIFTY_DOLLAR(5000)
HUNDRED_DOLLAR(10000)
6. Transaction
id: int [PK]
vendingMachineId: int [FK]
productId: int [FK]
amountInserted: Double
amountRequired: Double
changeReturned: Double
status: TransactionStatus (Enum: PENDING, COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELLED)
timestamp: long
7. TransactionStatus (Enum)
PENDING
COMPLETED
FAILED
CANCELLED
8. ProductCategory (Enum)
BEVERAGE
SNACK
CANDY
CHIPS
COOKIES
OTHER
9. Recovery (Power Failure Recovery)
id: int [PK]
vendingMachineId: int [FK]
transactionId: int [FK]
state: VendingMachineState (PROCESSING_PAYMENT or DISPENSING)
status: RecoveryStatus (Enum: PENDING, COMPLETED)
createdAt: long
completedAt: long (nullable)
10. RecoveryStatus (Enum)
PENDING
COMPLETED

Interview Tip: Clearly identifying entities and enums at this stage helps define relationships (like Product ↔ Inventory, VendingMachine ↔ CashBox) and ensures smooth implementation of State and Recovery mechanisms in the system.
